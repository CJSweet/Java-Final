# Java-Final

My teams Java class final. We made a zombie shooter game that takes place in the residence hall my two teammates and I lived in at the time. It is a top down shooter game where you can travel between two floors and zombie randomly spawn. The graphics were all done as sprites and the zombies are able to run through the walls (...oops). It was a fun game to make non-the-less.
